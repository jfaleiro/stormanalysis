# stormanalysis: Health and Economic Impact of Severe Weather Events

The basic goal of this study is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer some basic questions about health and economic impact of severe weather events across the United States, specifically:

1. Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?
2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

Our analysis is conducted in R and will consist of tables, figures and several summaries. We will take special care to document each of the steps, making sure they follow a fully scripted flow and therefore allow for the entire analysis to be fully reproducible.
